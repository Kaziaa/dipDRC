Description: Studies of the effects of drugs or other perturbations on cell proliferation 
	(especially cancer cells grown in culture) have generally been performed using percent 
	of viable cells after 72 hours of treatment. We have described the steady-state rate 
	of proliferation achieved after any drug equilibration as the drug-induced 
	proliferation (DIP) rate. In this package we provide functions to process raw data, 
	estimate the DIP rate, and analyze the concentration-dependent effects using the 
	dependent drc package.
